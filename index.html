    <p id="tribute-info">Sir Muhammad Iqbal (Urdu: محمد اقبال‎; 9 November 1877 – 21 April 1938) was a South Asian Muslim writer, philosopher, and politician, whose poetry in the Urdu language is among the greatest of the twentieth century, and whose vision of a cultural and political ideal for the Muslims of British-ruled India was to animate the impulse for Pakistan. He is commonly referred to by the honorific Allama (from Persian علامه ʻallāma, "very knowing, most learned".<br><br>Iqbal was a strong proponent of the political and spiritual revival of Islamic civilisation across the world, but in particular in South Asia; a series of lectures he delivered to this effect were published as The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam. A leader in the All India Muslim League, he envisioned—in his 1930 presidential address—a separate political framework for Muslims in British-ruled India.After the creation of Pakistan in 1947, he was named the national poet there.The anniversary of his birth (Yōm-e Welādat-e Muḥammad Iqbāl) on 9 November was a public holiday in Pakistan.
